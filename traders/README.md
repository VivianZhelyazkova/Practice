When ordering goods from a supplier, the trader receives a list of a randomly generated number of products, each with a name and a random price between 5 and 15 leva. The total price of the products represents the value of the delivery.
- Collect turnover from the commercial object – 130% of the value of the ordered goods. (In fact, traders have a 30% markup). The turnover represents the profit from a random number of sold items.
- Pay taxes to the state for the respective commercial object.
